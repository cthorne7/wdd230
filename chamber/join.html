        page from your project. You will be using the same CSS file references and 
        some of the JavaScript references as needed.

        Ensure that the design meets standards such as eye tracking in a straight line 
        and proper keyboard progression (tabs) for accessibility. See the week's activity
         and Designing more Efficient FormsLinks to an external site.
        Create a new page named "thankyou.html" that expresses gratitude for filling out 
        the form. This page should load when the user has successfully submitted the form. 
        The design should follow your site pattern and does not need to have a lot of 
        actual content.
